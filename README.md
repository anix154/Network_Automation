# ET2598-Assignment-2-Network Automation
In this repo, we are going to implement a simple web service via ansible playbook.
Ansible is an open-source automation tool, used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and provisioning. It improves the scalability, consistency, and reliability of IT environment. The main reason for using it, is its simplicity.

The purpose of Nginx web server is to serve one simple PHP page and that page will render the hostname, IP, and port of the server running it.
